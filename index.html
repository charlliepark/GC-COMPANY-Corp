<p>Simply put, <strong><u><a href="https://www.questionpro.com/blog/customer-churn/"
  target="_blank" title="customer churn definition"> customer churn</a></u></strong> occurs
when customers or subscribers stop doing business with a company or service.</p>
<img src='cust.jpg' width="70%">
<p style="margin-top:40px">customer churn is a critical metric
because it is much less expensive to retain existing customers than it is to acquire new customers
_earning business from new customers means working leads all the way through the sales funnel,
utilizing your marketing and sales resources throughout the process.
Customer retention, on the other hand, is generally more cost-effective
as youâ€™ve already earned the trust and loyalty of existing customers.</p>erence considerations, interestingness metrics, complexity considerations, post-processing of discovered structures, visualization, and online updating
